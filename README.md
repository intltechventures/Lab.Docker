TroubleShooting
* Docker on Windows 10
	* https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/04/16/installing-docker-windows-fixes-common-problems/
	* Boot2Docker Start shortcut doesn’t work – the Boot2Docker Start shortcut doesn’t run the start.sh script in a Bash shell, associate the .sh file extension with the ```<Git home>/bin/sh.exe``` program or some other Bash shell emulator for Windows.
